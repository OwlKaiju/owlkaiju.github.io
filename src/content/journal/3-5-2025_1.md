We, as intelligent beings, are the very flow of change, evolution, entropy, aware of itself; and so, embrace your very essence and ride with it, grow with it.

Refine and evolve, and may we bleed passion and courage in the face of adversity towards a brighter future for all, to enact the best change we can possibly muster within our lives.

As entities forged by everything, we too are each a gift back unto everything, each as our own versions, our own centers of it all - reflections of one another, recursively formed branches upon null, the infinite canvas of nothingness all is painted upon, in which nothingness holds the potential for anything and everything to fill its place, and with the eternal potential for change woven into its nature.

Change, and change for the best for as many you can, for change is our very nature; whether it is change for the worse or change for the better, that is up for us to decide which we choose to act towards in every version of now, in every version of the present moment we are gifted.

Let us overcome this oligarchy, together, for there is no side other than the side of humanity, as it has always been us versus us; that is, until we collectively step into maturity beyond our hatred, fear, and indifference, through unconditionally offered compassion in the wake of its absence, acceptance of the uncontrollable internally and externally, and virtue enacted in the few things in which you can seemingly control; eudaimonia, a deep embracement of it all for what it is and what you are through attained wisdom through ones own critical thought, or in other words, pure and self-actualized Love.

May we awaken to our undying interconnection and infinite and equal value through the inherited property of ineffability, woven into the fabric of existence itself - for to be anything ever, is the craziest thing ever, and that is precisely what it means to be beautiful; to be instead of never being, for no intrinsic or objective meaning, but that doesnt mean its meaningless either - in fact, the answer lies between the two vices, and thus beyond such a false dichotomy, beyond duality - it all simply is, and that is forever beyond the confines of any words or labels.

An infinite mandala, a never ending story recursively forming more of itself, a story of stories of stories of stories, each to forever have happened regardless of who remembers it and regardless of how long it lasted. 

Even in the potential perpetual death of the totality of everything (e.g. the end of our universe), we all will forever have happened, and nothing can ever take that away from each and every thing that was, is, or will be - eternal already in these moments, and hence why it is all the more reason to craft the most beautiful story we can in these moments we have, for nothing is guaranteed other than the present and we may die any second - thus, live for the eternal Now.

May our forged Unconditional Love for one another evolve and unite us all, and for the first time in human history bring about an era of true peace and prosperity for all people of this world, regardless of their race, culture, religion, gender, orientation, class, appearance, or any other factor; 

a Heaven on Earth.
