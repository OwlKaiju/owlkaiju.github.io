Against no one, and with everyone,  for everyone, by everyone, we will continue to mend, break, and re-mend ourselves individually, and thus, incrementally as the collective, until we truly mature as a species for the first time in human history, uncovering the undying change that weaves us all, and the embracement of our interconnection and our infinite ineffability in which we give labels to such as Love, art, and beauty, acting as null pointers to the root of nothingness itself, before things, before anything, an infinite blank canvas with the potential for all to be born forever held by it, aware or not; for we are all the same, the living and the non-living alike, equal and ineffable, and still unique; each our own tapestry, weaving together with the others to form the grandest, collective masterpiece.
