(Messages I sent to a friend during conversation over discord)

In the series both the Aeon of Totality and the Aeon of Null both by themselves are not good! but together, they too form change, and the infinite story in the good ending of the series

There's the Aeon of Absence / Null and the Aeon of Totality, so 2 vices - except usually ppl think of like darkness and absence of all as like the devil and the presence of everything as God, but in my story either of them by themselves is actually a bad thing - bc if it was just one or the other, there would be no change, and change is divine, change is infinity, change is the greatest gift and why everything can change to nothing, nothing can change to everything, and so infinite growth - hence, the lead protagonists of this story form the Aeon of Change collectively as if one being

The Aeon of Hate (in actuality, is The Aeon of Fear, and even deeper than that is the Aeon of Ignorance - from the unknown fear is born in the absence of understanding, wisdom; and from fear and ignorance, hate is born) - "In its chamber, everything appeared massive, entrapping me within; the pools were of a thick red mud,  and from the center, a hole opened within the mud; and there it stood, right before me, towering above, myself deep in its projected shadow."

They're all one in the same

Different masks of the same thingy

Hatred and anger building a shield from the unknown

Internal walls against trying to understand further

Scared to take the step outside the comfort zone

Demonizing anything that lies outside of it
and lacking the wisdom to know better
