Normality never existed, it was only ever an illusion we told ourselves to get some sense of control over reality (the collective average narrative forged by the subjective minds of the world, the noösphere), when in actuality, the only true control we can ever gain is by understanding and accepting that virtually everything may as well be entirely uncontrollable, including ourselves if free will is also an illusion; in doing so, fear vanishes entirely, and you can truly say you’ve matured - to seek pseudo control and tell yourself these lies and illusions is the precise definition of immaturity, seeking comfort and to remain in familiarity as if you hold all the cards when you never have and never will.
