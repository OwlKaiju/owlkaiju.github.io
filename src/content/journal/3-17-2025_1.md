It’s actually a great thing we all don’t agree on everything, bc it allows us collectively as a species to tackle problems from all sorts of different and unique perspectives so we can find the most balanced approach across all; if nobody disagreed with each other, we, we’d just be like the same damn person!!! We’d be a literal hive mind lmao! It’s a blessing we can even disagree; the greatest thing ever is to be different, and everything shares in that equally and infinitely - its own unique copy, otherwise, it’d literally not be its own thing, it’d be something else - even if they’re identical clones and everything, even a difference in position still counts as a difference - and this difference is exactly what people call “weird” and form prejudices and stereotypes and etc around, when in reality, the very definition of “cool” is to embrace your weirdness, to embrace yourself, or in other words, self love; and after you can learn to love yourself, very quickly do you realize you can apply that to literally anyone and anything else; they’re all different copies of that same absurdity you have too, different filters atop the same infinite blank canvas upon which everything is painted on and each being its own recursive copy of that blank canvas with just as much infinite potential, that is, to be anything, to exist at all in the first place, to have changed from the nothing into something, and that too is precisely what everything shares in forever - even if everything were to end and nothing were to happen ever again, we’ll still have happened, and nothing can ever take that away from us - we’re already eternal in these moments, remembered even when no one is left to remember, even if everything were to vanish - that’s how I see it, anyways :)

The irony of it too, is that everything is weird, because it’s different from being the nothing in which it seemingly came from!!! If nobody was weird we’d all be the same person; if nothing was different, well, we’d all just be nothing or just some unchanging “thing”as one forever! And so to refute something for being weird or different, is to directly refute your very being, your very nature, to refute yourself - we are change aware of itself, change that initiates that difference, and the truest form of immaturity is to deny it… until, with experience and critical thought, over time you come to break down the illusion by overcoming ignorance with knowledge, fear with wisdom, and hate with empathy, respect, and love.
