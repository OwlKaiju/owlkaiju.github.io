To be anything ever in the first place is already the most profound, insane, and absurd thing ever, and that is precisely what it means to be beautiful, and everything shares in that equally and infinitely, for everything is rooted in ineffability and all words are merely made up approximations to attempt to capture the infinite potential that is woven into existence as a whole, woven into the presence, absence, or anywhere in between, paint upon the same infinite blank canvas.

If nobody was weird, we’d all be the same person; and if nothing was weird or abnormal, nothing would even exist in the first place because existence is already the craziest thing ever which we take for granted, but fail to realize it once was the greatest unknown before we were born, but we inevitably changed into it. I view change to be the most divine thing ever, and it need not some conscious god in order to be just as wonderful and just as much of a gift. 

In fact, by our system of logic anyways, a conscious first god also would exist in the same dilemma as us where “all we may know is that we know nothing” as Socrates once said, for even if the god were to say they’ve “always been,” they could’ve been made by another god who granted them all the ability and knowledge ever other than the ability to know they came from something else and thus an implanted memory of sorts and the power being an illusion; the same could apply to the higher up god and ad infinitum until you perhaps reach a god who finally understands or knows “oh I came from nothingness,” in which case nothingness itself is essentially God; more-so, the potential for everything to fill its place, and given enough time (and since there is quite literally nothing and thus no flow of entropy or sense of time at all in null), anything that can happen WILL happen; in that way, even if we returned to the same nothingness we were born from after death, we are inevitable to change again - and THAT is the greatest gift, and the most insane craziest thing ever - and it is not objectively meaningful by any means, but that does not mean it is meaningless either; it all simply is, and we are change aware of itself, able to grant itself no meaning, or to paint and dance upon its grand canvas, and behold its potential infinite meaning, and in realizing this, recognize that infinite compassion for the eternal interconnected nature of all things was always the state of being we’ve always been seeking, and we never needed anything else other than ourselves to realize that.
