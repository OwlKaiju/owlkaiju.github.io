For the majority of my life, I lived in the sweet false bliss of ignorance and privilege. 

Now, however, the hydra is after my skin too, and I can finally understand firsthand, fully, that injustice anywhere a threat to justice as a whole, as MLK once said. 

This day forward, even in times of peace for my specific phenotypes, I vow to always fight for justice for all people, anyone and anywhere. 

The question now, is how do you deal with the hydra? Most think to either befriend or kill the hydra…. But is there a third option not tried before? Is there something that unconditional love can tell me that I’m not hearing clearly quite yet? How can you bridge beyond even good and evil, and into transcendence? To put the anger and illusion that spurs within the mind of the hydra to rest, without killing it, so we may all collectively mature as one?

Time will tell.
